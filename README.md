Samples of Spring MVC + Hibernate

The project is all documented with useful explanations about the main classes of the Spring framework. It was made a basic integration with Hibernate, without an explicit declaration of the "persistence.xml", everything was configured using @annotations.

In case of any question or tip please contact me.
